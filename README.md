Employee Management System

This is an Employee Management System built with Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The system follows a component-based architecture on the frontend and MVC (Model-View-Controller) on the backend. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used for authentication and authorization on both the frontend and backend.
Features

    User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using JWT tokens.

    CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on employee records.

    Role-based Access Control: Different roles for users (e.g., Admin, Employee) with role-based access control for the system's resources.

    Responsive UI: Modern and responsive user interface using React.js components.

Technologies Used
Backend

    Spring Boot: For creating the backend REST API.

    Spring Security: For implementing JWT-based authentication and authorization.

    JPA (Java Persistence API): For data persistence using an H2 or MySQL database.

    JWT (JSON Web Token): For secure token-based authentication.

Frontend

    React.js: Component-based architecture for building the user interface.

    React Router: For routing and navigation between views.

    Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

    Java 8+ (for Spring Boot)

    Node.js and npm (for React frontend)

    MySQL or H2 database (depending on configuration)

Backend Setup

    Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend

Build and run the Spring Boot application:

    mvn spring-boot:run

    The backend should now be running at http://localhost:8080.

Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend folder:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the React development server:

    npm start

    The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

How JWT Authentication Works

    The user logs in with their credentials via the POST /api/auth/login endpoint.

    The backend validates the credentials and generates a JWT token.

    The token is sent back to the frontend and is stored (usually in localStorage).

    For every subsequent request, the token is included in the request headers under Authorization as a Bearer token.

    The backend verifies the token using a secret key and allows or denies access to protected routes based on the user's role and permissions.
